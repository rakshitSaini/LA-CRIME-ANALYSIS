# LA-CRIME-ANALYSIS
This project analyzes crime data using time-series visualization and statistical insights. We explore crime trends over the years, identify the most common crime types, and examine reporting delays. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we create line plots, scatter plots, and histograms to uncover patterns.
