# CRIME ANALYSIS FOR HOMEBUYERS IN LOS ANGELES

LA Crime Analysis – I chose this project because everyone dreams of buying a house in Los Angeles. It's better to plan everything in advance, so one night, I was thinking about how I could achieve that and where I would buy a house in Los Angeles. I started searching for datasets related to LA and found one with crime reports. That’s when I thought, why not start with this?

LA is a highly competitive and expensive market, with a median home price of around $1.1 million and a high cost of living. Crime is also a significant factor to consider when making a decision.
